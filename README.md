# Water-Flow-Meter-with-LCD-Display
This Arduino-based project measures water flow using a Hall-effect flow sensor and displays the flow rate and total volume on a 16x2 LCD. It also allows the user to set a flow volume limit, triggering a buzzer when the limit is exceeded. Ideal for monitoring water usage and flow rates in various applications.
